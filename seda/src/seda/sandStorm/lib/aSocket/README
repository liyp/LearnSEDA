This library provides a SEDA-based asynchronous sockets layer, using the 
Sandstorm platform. It may be used by itself, without the rest of the 
Sandstorm APIs, simply by including 

	import seda.sandStorm.api.*;
	import seda.sandStorm.core.*;
	import seda.sandStorm.lib.aSocket.*;

in your Java application. See ATcpClientSocket, ATcpServerSocket, and 
ATcpConnection for the basic APIs. 

Let me know if you have any questions!
