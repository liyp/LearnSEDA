<b>NBIO</b> is a library which implements nonblocking I/O facilities for Java. 
Surprisingly,
the standard JDK libraries (prior to JDK 1.4) do not provide nonblocking I/O.
This means that in order to implement applications (such as web servers
and other Internet services) which support many concurrent I/O streams,
a large number of threads must be used. However, the overhead of threading
(in Java, as well as more generally) limits the performance of such an
implementation. 

<p>
What is needed is a nonblocking I/O library which allows a small number of
threads to be used, along with a <tt>select()</tt> or <tt>poll()</tt> 
like mechanism to test for incoming I/O events on a large number of 
streams. This is what NBIO provides.

<p>

<p>
NBIO is implemented using native calls (through JNI) to create and
manage nonblocking sockets, as well as to provide <tt>select()</tt>-like
functionality (that is, to test for I/O readiness or completion across a
large number of sockets). For event delivery, NBIO supports both the 
UNIX <tt>poll(2)</tt> system call and the <tt>/dev/poll</tt> 
event-delivery mechanism. (Note that <tt>select()</tt> itself is not
used, mainly because on most UNIX systems <tt>select()</tt> does not
perform well with a large number of sockets.)

NBIO is known to work on Linux 2.2 and 2.4 systems, Solaris 7 and 8, 
FreeBSD, and HP/UX. Because it uses standard UNIX system calls, it 
should simply work with, or at least be easy to port to, a large number 
of other UNIX systems. 

<p>
We have also made a BETA release of NBIO for Windows 2000 systems.
It is available from the <a href="http://seda.sourceforge.net">SEDA
SourceForge pages</a>.

<p>
The recently-announced JDK 1.4 beta includes the package
<tt>java.nio</tt> which, among other things, provides nonblocking I/O 
primitives for Java. As it turns out I am on the expert group for the
Sun Java Specification Request for this package
(see <a href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/051.jsp">this link</a> for more
details). More details on this new API can be found
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/nio/index.html">at this
URL</a>; as you can see, <tt>java.nio</tt> has been influenced somewhat
by the NBIO APIs. 

<p>
My plan is to continue developing and supporting NBIO until stable,
released versions of JDK 1.4 are available on Linux both from Sun and
IBM. At that point I will deprecate NBIO in favor of the new APIs, but
NBIO will continue to be supported (although the development will be frozen).
Migration from NBIO to <tt>java.nio</tt> should not be difficult. If
you are in need of an efficient, working nonblocking I/O library for
Java, my recommendation is to go ahead and use NBIO, and move over to 
<tt>java.nio</tt> once it is available. 

<p>
Note that the <a href="sandstorm.html">Sandstorm</a> system can use
either NBIO or <tt>java.nio</tt> for nonblocking I/O.

<p>
If you are compiling the complete SEDA code tree (including NBIO,
Sandstorm, etc.), simply follow 
<a href="sandstorm.html">the instructions in the Sandstorm release notes</a>
instead of those given here. If you only wish to compile NBIO, 
you need to configure the following environment variables:

<ol>
<li> Be sure that your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> contains the following two
     entries:
  <ul>
  <li> The "<tt>seda/src</tt>" directory in the SEDA release;
  <li> The "<tt>.</tt>" directory
  </ul>

<p>
For example, under Bourne-style UNIX shells, type:
<pre>
  CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/seda/src:.
  export CLASSPATH
</pre>
Under C-style shells:
<pre>
  setenv CLASSPATH "$CLASSPATH":/path/to/seda/src:.
</pre>
Replacing <tt>/path/to/seda</tt> with the directory where you unpacked
the SEDA release.

<p>
<li> Be sure that your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> contains the "<tt>seda/lib</tt>"
directory in the SEDA release. This is necessary for the JVM to locate
the NBIO native libraries. 

<p>Under Bourne-style shells,
<pre>
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/seda/lib
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
Under C-style shells,
<pre>
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH":/path/to/seda/lib
</pre>
</ol>

<p>
To compile NBIO, simply <tt>cd</tt> to the <tt>seda/src/nbio</tt>
directory and type <tt>make</tt>. If there are any problems with
compilation, be absolutely sure that <tt>seda/src</tt> and "<tt>.</tt>"
are in fact on your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>. This is the most common
problem when building the code.

<p>
This package is called <tt>seda.nbio</tt>. 

<p>
You can <a href="javadoc/index.html">read the JavaDoc documentation for NBIO
here</a>. The public classes included in the package are:

<p>
<dl>
<dt> <b><tt>NonblockingInputStream</tt></b>
<dd> A subclass of <tt>java.io.InputStream</tt> which supports 
nonblocking semantics. 

<p>
<dt> <b><tt>NonblockingOutputStream</tt></b>
<dd> A subclass of <tt>java.io.OutputStream</tt> which supports nonblocking
semantics.

<p>
<dt> <b><tt>NonblockingSocket</tt></b>
<dd>A subclass of <tt>java.net.Socket</tt> which supports nonblocking 
semantics. Socket connection and read/write are nonblocking.

<p>
<dt> <b><tt>NonblockingServerSocket</tt></b>
<dd>A variant of <tt>java.net.ServerSocket</tt> which supports nonblocking 
semantics. Connection accept is nonblocking.

<p>
<dt> <b><tt>NonblockingDatagramSocket</tt></b>
<dd>A variant of <tt>java.net.DatagramSocket</tt> which supports nonblocking 
semantics. Socket read/write are nonblocking.

<p>
<dt> <b><tt>NonblockingMulticastSocket</tt></b>
<dd>A variant of <tt>java.net.MulticastSocket</tt> which supports nonblocking 
semantics. Socket read/write are nonblocking.

<p>
<dt> <b><tt>SelectSet</tt></b>
<dd> A class which implements <tt>select()</tt>, allowing you to poll for
events across a number of nonblocking I/O streams. The interface
is in fact very similar to the SVR4 <tt>poll()</tt> system call.

<p>
<dt> <b><tt>SelectItem</tt></b>
<dd>A class which represents a single nonblocking I/O stream to be
used with SelectSet.

<p>
In the <tt>test</tt> directory you will find a number of test programs which
demonstrate the use of this library:

<p>
<dl>
<dt> <b><tt>test/test</tt></b>
<dd> Blocking and nonblocking variants of a simple server and client 
application, used for demonstration purposes.

<p>
<dt> <b><tt>test/p2p-bench</tt></b>
<dd>  The <tt>TCPBench</tt> program is a point-to-point TCP benchmark, 
like <tt>ttcp</tt> for Java. It can use either blocking or nonblocking 
sockets, and reports both round-trip latency and bandwidth for a given 
message size.

<p>
<dt> <b><tt>test/multi-bench</tt></b>
<dd>  The <tt>MultiServer</tt> program is a benchmark which implements a simple
  TCP server which supports many connections. It is capable of 
  using either nonblocking sockets (with a single thread) or blocking
  sockets (with many threads). It exchanges a series of packets 
  which each client that connects to it. The benchmark reports
  the total bandwidth measured by the server. The <tt>MultiClient</tt>
  program is used as the client.

<p>
Note that NBIO is for use with <b>NATIVE THREADS ONLY</b>, not
the "Green Threads" package supported by older JVMs. I believe that 
all JVMs from JDK 1.3 onwards only support native threads, so this is
not a problem for most users. However, if you are using an older JVM
with Green Threads, you need to be aware of this issue.

<p>
The problem is that a blocking call to <tt>SelectSet.select()</tt> 
actually blocks the OS thread making the call. If you are using Green 
Threads, this will block the entire JVM, because Green Threads uses 
a single OS thread to emulate many Java threads. This is fine for a 
single-threaded application, but in general you only want to block 
the <em>Java</em> thread making the call. Supporting this behavior 
under Green Threads is complicated and I don't think it's important;
with the NBIO library you should be able to use native threads, since you
will need much fewer of them than you would with blocking I/O.

<p>
Of course, you can use the other NBIO routines (nonblocking sockets, etc.) 
with Green Threads, since they do not block. <tt>SelectSet.select()</tt>
is the only real problem. However, since Green Threads appears to be
obsolete, I strongly recommend only using Native Threads with NBIO.

<p>
If you are running on Linux 2.2.x systems you may wish to increase your
file descriptor limit, which increases the number of simultaneous socket
connections the system can have. This is important as one of the basic 
uses for NBIO is to write server applications which can support many 
simultaneous connections (many more connections than were possible 
using threads). This is relatively simple to do:

<ol>
<li> Create the file <tt>/etc/initscript</tt> (if it does not already
exist) and place the following commands into it:
<pre>
umask 022
ulimit -c 2097151
ulimit -Hn 32768
PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
export PATH
eval exec "$4"
</pre>
If <tt>/etc/initscript</tt> already exists, add the command
<pre>
ulimit -Hn 32768
</pre>
to it.

<p>
<li> Add the following commands to <tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</tt> (or some
other startup script which is run at boot time):
<pre>
echo 32768 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/file-max
echo 65536 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/inode-max
</pre>

<p>
<li> Add the following command to your login scripts (e.g.,
<tt>.bashrc</tt> or <tt>.cshrc</tt>):
<pre>
ulimit -n 32768
</pre>

<p>
<li> Reboot the system for the above changes to take effect.
</ol>

<p>
In the future we would like to support nonblocking disk I/O, however, most
UNIX-based operating systems do not in fact support nonblocking access to
disk files; you must use a lower-level "raw disk" facility instead.
If anyone wishes to implement nonblocking file or disk I/O for NBIO,
please get in touch with the SEDA project developers.
