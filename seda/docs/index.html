<p>
The Staged Event-Driven Architecture (SEDA) is a new design for building
scalable Internet services. SEDA has three major goals:
<ul>
<li> To support massive concurrency, on the order of tens of thousands
of clients per node;
<li> To exhibit robust performance under wide variations in load; and,
<li> To simplify the design of complex Internet services.
</ul>

<p>
SEDA decomposes a complex, event-driven application into a set of 
<em>stages</em> connected by <em>queues</em>. This design avoids the high 
overhead associated with thread-based concurrency models, and decouples 
event and thread scheduling from application logic. SEDA enables services 
to be well-conditioned to load, preventing resources from being 
overcommitted when demand exceeds service capacity. Decomposing services 
into a set of stages also enables modularity and code reuse, as well 
as the development of debugging tools for complex event-driven applications.

<p>
The SEDA project currently consists of two software packages.
<ul>
<li> <a href="nbio.html">NBIO</a>, 
a library providing nonblocking socket I/O interfaces in Java
<li> <a href="sandstorm.html">Sandstorm</a>, 
a Java-based Internet services platform, based on the SEDA design
</ul>
Please follow the links above for information on requirements,
installation, and use of each package.

<p>
Sandstorm provides a rich set of interfaces for developing SEDA-based
Internet services, and uses the NBIO library (or, alternately, the 
JDK 1.4 <tt>java.nio</tt> package) for nonblocking I/O operations.
NBIO can also be used by itself, without Sandstorm.
